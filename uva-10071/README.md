A particle has initial velocity and acceleration. If its velocity after certain time is v then what will its displacement be in twice of that time?

### Input

The input will contain two integers in each line. Each line makes one set of input. These two integers denote the value of v (−100 ≤ v ≤ 100) and t (0 ≤ t ≤ 200) (t means at the time the particle gains that velocity)

### Output
For each line of input print a single integer in one line denoting the displacement in double of that time.

### Sample Input
```
0 0
5 12
```

### Sample Output
```
0
120
```

*Note: Assume the initial velocity is 0 and acceleration is constant, then displacement can be calculated based on final velocity and travelling time as the following:*
```
    S = V * t / 2
```
